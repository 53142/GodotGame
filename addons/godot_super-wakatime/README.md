<!-- ABOUT -->
## About The Project
<br />

[![Product Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://waka.hackclub.com)

This tool can successfully measure time spent building your games or apps in Godot.
<br />
Here's why:
* It differentiates between switching a scene and script
* It counts key presses as coding and mouse clicks as building scene
* Changing scene structure results in a heartbeat sent
* It correctly detects OS, machine name, language, editor, files
* It can detect your cursor line and position
* Time is split between: Building, Coding, Testing
* In the future it will also detect testing your projects

It works on both Linux and Windows, it wasn't tested on macOS yet
<br />
You can also see your time spent in the editor itself:

### Built Using
I used the Ouch! CLI tool for decompression of files <br />
This project was built using one simple, yet powerful language.<br />
It required a lot of workarounds, but it was a pleasure to use it
